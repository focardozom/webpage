title: About
---

I grew up in Colombia, where I studied psychology and earned both my undergraduate and master's degrees. I then moved to Miami to continue my education and obtain a Ph.D in Prevention Science at the Miller School of Medicine at the University of Miami. In Miami, I have been working on designing and evaluating preventive interventions, and have collaborated to teach R and machine learning. In my free time, I enjoy playing chess and reading about the history of science, particularly the lives of logicians, mathematicians, and statisticians. I am also passionate about learning new methods and programming languages and using them to analyze data and gain insights. I am very concerned about current political and social conflicts and the impact of climate change on our world. However, I still am optimistic.
