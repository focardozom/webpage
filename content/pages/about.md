title: About
---

My focus as a researcher has been on evaluating interventions in real-world contexts. I have spent several years studying statistics, research methods, and have gained expertise in conducting and designing experiments and observational studies to test intervention effects. 

From an evaluation standpoint, I am proficient in conducting efficacy and effectiveness trials. I am able to identify theory of change of interventions and use it to create models and select instruments. I know how to develop monitoring and evaluation systems and create automatic reproducible reports to communicate results. 

From a measurement perspective, I am able to implement data reduction techniques such as exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis to test for the reliability and validity of questionnaires, as well as using mixture modeling techniques like latent class analysis to identify subpopulations targeted by interventions. Additionally, I have been utilizing structural equation to understand the effectiveness of interventions, for whom they work, and how. 

In terms of data analysis, I am proficient in using descriptive and inferential statistics, conducting causal analysis (i.e., propensity score, regression discontinuity, and differences in differences), and implementing machine learning techniques (i.e. regression and classification). As a data scientist at Figura 1 Corporation, I have delved into predictive modeling, which has introduced me to the world of Bayesian statistics, kernels, and neural networks. I am also trained to conduct thematic analysis and the general inductive approach from a qualitative perspective. 

In terms of programming, I am proficient in R and have experience using Python and Julia to implement machine learning. I am also skilled in creating webpages using Blogdown, Git, and Netlify, and can use shiny for web applications. 

My academic background in psychology has taught me the importance of effectively communicating complex ideas to a broader audience. I believe in the importance of translating research findings into something useful that can help people make decisions. 

In summary, my goal as a researcher is to evaluate if interventions make changes in real-life contexts. To achieve this, I combine measurement and research design to obtain rigorous results. I am pragmatic when it comes to methods and have a diverse set of tools at my disposal. I am committed to effectively communicating research findings in a clear and useful way.
