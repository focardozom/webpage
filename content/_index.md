## Hi there! 👋

<img class="avatar" src="img/me.png" alt="avatar">

Welcome to my page! My name is Francisco, and I am a psychologist with a passion for evaluating the impact of social programs.

In this page, you will find about my background and qualifications in the field of program evaluation, including my primary area of research in the prevention of alcohol use among adolescents, my experience in using statistical methods to evaluate program efficacy and my current Ph.D studies in Prevention Science at the University of Miami.

You will also discover my dedication to using both quantitative and qualitative methods to gain a comprehensive understanding of program effectiveness. My ultimate goal is to use evidence-based actions to improve the impact of social programs and make a positive difference in people's lives. Additionally, I am currently working as a data scientist for Figura 1, an enterprise dedicated to conducting program evaluations. I also use social network research in my research.

I am also a geek when it comes to using software such as R, Julia and Python to analyze data and uncover insights.

Thank you for visiting my page, I hope you find it informative. If you have any further questions or would like to learn more about my work, please do not hesitate to contact me.
